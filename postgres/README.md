# Identity PostgreSQL

Experimental Go 1.27 module implementing `identity.UserQueryRepository` using
the owned `go-postgres` pool. Tenant and user IDs are matched exactly; lifecycle
states and the full uint64 version range are preserved. Reads are primary-only,
bounded and uncached. Configure primary endpoints explicitly.

Construct with `NewRepository(pool, Config{MaximumDuration: time.Second})`, then
compose it through `identity.NewUserQueryService` for policy and redaction.
The caller owns pool shutdown. No globals or background goroutines are created.
Driver errors are discarded rather than exposed through `errors.As` or logs.
Cancellation and deadline classifications remain observable.

## Current development boundary

`MigrationSource{}` owns `identity.users` with `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `status`
and `version`. Compose the source with the existing `go-migrations/v3` Runner
and PostgreSQL backend before constructing the repository. The source creates
no private ledger or migration runner. Initial install requires an unoccupied
`identity` schema and runs atomically. Replayed migrations preserve populated
data; destructive downgrade is unsupported. Future changes append history.

It is not yet an adoptable complete durable identity adapter. Do not
write application-owned identity tables or transactions to bridge that gap.
Commands, snapshots, attributes, imports, lifecycle cascades, audit/outbox,
reconciliation and the shared transaction coordinator remain unfinished.

### FAQ

- Can I use a replica? No; the repository's primary consistency contract is
  required for security composition.
- Are reads authorization? No; use the identity query service.
- Can I request extra fields? Only `id`, `tenant_id`, `status` and `version`
  are supported; unknown or duplicate fields are rejected, not ignored.
- Is the pool closed by the adapter? No; the application retains ownership.
- Is this released? No. Full adapter implementation and release gates remain pending.

## Integration testing

`go test -tags integration ./...` requires `IDENTITY_POSTGRES_TEST_DSN` pointing
to an explicitly disposable loopback PostgreSQL cluster with database
`identity_test` and database-creation permission. Each invocation creates and
removes its own random database; it never drops the supplied seed database.
Missing infrastructure fails the selected lane rather than skipping it.

PostgreSQL `numeric` with scale/range checks preserves all uint64 versions and
rejects fractional values; a scale-constrained type would round before checks.
See [PostgreSQL numeric semantics](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/datatype-numeric.html).
